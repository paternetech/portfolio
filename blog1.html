        <p>When it comes to office automation, the first thing that comes to mind is Microsoft Office. One cannot imagine a Windows-based computer without a local copy of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The future may hold the key to cloud-based apps, but as of now, a pretty large chunk of Microsoft users is still dependent on local installations. For the past few years, an exception being the statement released on Jan 24-25 2013, the office automation software bundle from Microsoft generated more revenue compared to its Windows range of operating systems.</p><br>
    </div>
    <h2>History of Microsoft Office Software</h2><br>
    <p>The evolution of office automation is tied to the evolution of Microsoft Office as the latter remained and stays ahead in offering the latest features that enhance and support the functions required by the ever-changing needs of business houses worldwide.</p><br>
    <h2>Microsoft Word For MS-DOS – Pre Windows Era</h2><br>
    <p>The history of MS Office starts officially from November 19, 1990, when Office for Windows (also called MS Office 1.0) came out for use with Windows 2.0. Before Office 1.0, the basic elements of the package were still available as separate programs but for MS-DOS. The primary input devices for pre-Windows Microsoft Word were keyboards. The mouse was a luxury not used by many. Though they have many good features, formatting and printing require good expertise. You can still download one of the DOS-based Word from the Internet – but I won’t recommend any site as I don’t know if they would be clean.</p><br>

    <h2>Evolution & History Of MS Office: From Keyboard To Touch Interface
    </h2><br>
    <p>We will take you on a pictorial tour of the different versions of Microsoft Office that debuted as an add-on for Windows 2.0 and went on to change the face of office automation across the business houses on the planet. It shifted users from the then famous WordPerfect to MS Word and killed the former’s market. A major factor for the huge success of MS Office was and is the keyboard shortcut system as opposed to the formatting system of WordPerfect that required users to type in special codes.</p><br>
